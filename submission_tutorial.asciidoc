== Submission Tutorial

If you're new to git and GitHub and just want to keep things as simple as possible, this tutorial will give you a quick and easy way to make your contribution.  If you want to know all about git and how everything works, the tool on which GitHub is built, try these great resources:

* http://try.github.com/[Try GitHub].  A great interactive tutorial that will give you the basics in a nice, interactive environment.  
* http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFkgSjRnay4[Git in one hour].  Awesome intro video.
* http://git-scm.com/book[Pro Git].  The online book from Scott Chacon.

If you just want to keep it short and sweet, here's a way to make your contribution using only the functionality built into GitHub.


=== Create a GitHub account

To create and edit a page or to comment on an existing page, you will need to create an account on GitHub. If you don't have one already, then go to the https://github.com/signup/free[GitHub Signup page].  It's free.

=== Fork the project

Once you've got an account, fork (or copy) the main project into your account.  To do this, go to the  https://github.com/oreillymedia/97-things-every-agile-developer-should-know[97 Things repository on GitHub] and  click the "Fork" button at the upper right hand side of the screen.
