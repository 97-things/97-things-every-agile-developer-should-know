If you're new to git and GitHub and just want to keep things as simple as possible, this tutorial will give you a quick and easy way to make your contribution.  If you want to know all about git and how everything works, the tool on which GitHub is built, try these great resources:

* http://try.github.com/[Try GitHub].  A great interactive tutorial that will give you the basics in a nice, interactive environment.  
* http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFkgSjRnay4[Git in one hour].  Awesome intro video.
* http://git-scm.com/book[Pro Git].  The online book from Scott Chacon.

If you just want to keep it short and sweet, here's a way to make your contribution using only the functionality built into GitHub.


=== Create a GitHub account

To create and edit a page or to comment on an existing page, you will need to create an account on GitHub. If you don't have one already, then go to the https://github.com/signup/free[GitHub Signup page].  It's free.

=== Fork the project

Once you've got an account, fork (or copy) the main project into your account.  To do this, go to the  https://github.com/oreillymedia/97-things-every-agile-developer-should-know[97 Things repository on GitHub] and  click the "Fork" button at the upper right hand side of the screen.

The following screen will appear while GitHub copies the repository to your account:

=== Navigate to the "contributions" directory

Once the repository is forked to your account, you will need to navigate to the "contributions" directory.  All you need to do is click on the directory name in the list of files.

=== Click the "+" button next to the directory name to create a new file

Locate the small "\+" sign next to the "contributions" directory name.  (A tooltip will appear that says "Create a new file here" when you hover your mouse above it.)  Click the "\+" button:

=== Name the file and enter your title

In the new screen: 

* Enter a name for the file.  You should name the file using the convention using your first and last name with an ".asciidoc" at the end.  For example, "andrew_odewahn.asciidoc".
* Enter the title in the editing box; it should be prefaced with two "==" signs.  For example, "== Always Foo the Bar"
* Once you've entered the filename and title, the "Commit Changes" button at the bottom of the screen will activate.  Click the button to save your file.

You will see something like this:

=== Edit your file using AsciiDoc

Once you've got the file created, you can start editing it at your leisure.  To edit the file, all you have to do is click its name in the direcotry listing in GitHub and then press the "Edit" button:
