== Submission Tutorial

If you're new to git and GitHub and just want to keep things as simple as possible, this tutorial will give you a quick and easy way to make your contribution.  If you want to know all about git, the tool on which GitHub is built, try these great resources:

* http://try.github.com/[Try GitHub].  A great interactive tutorial that will give you the basics in a nice, interactive environment.  
* http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFkgSjRnay4[Git in one hour].  Awesome intro video.
* http://git-scm.com/book[Pro Git].  The online book from Scott Chacon.

But if you just want to keep it short and sweet, here's a way to make your contribution using only the functionality built into GitHub.


=== Create a GitHub account

To create and edit a page or to comment on an existing page, you will need to create an account on GitHub. If you don't have one already, then go to the https://github.com/signup/free[GitHub Signup page]. It's free.

=== Fork the project

Once you've got an account, fork (GitHub lingo for copying) the main project to your account.  To do this, go to the  https://github.com/oreillymedia/97-things-every-agile-developer-should-know[97 Things repository on GitHub] and click the "Fork" button at the upper right hand side of the screen.

The following screen will appear while GitHub copies the repository to your account:

=== Navigate to the "contributions" directory

Once the repository is forked to your account, you will need to navigate to the "contributions" directory.  All you need to do is click on the directory name in the list of files.

=== Click the "+" button next to the directory name to create a new file

Locate the small "\+" sign next to the "contributions" directory name.  (A tooltip will appear that says "Create a new file here" when you hover your mouse above it.)  Click the "\+" button:

=== Name the file and enter your title

In the new screen: 

* Enter a name for the file.  You should name the file using the convention using your first and last name with an ".asciidoc" at the end.  For example, "andrew_odewahn.asciidoc".
* Enter the title in the editing box; it should be prefaced with two "==" signs.  For example, "== Always Foo the Bar"
* Once you've entered the filename and title, the "Commit Changes" button at the bottom of the screen will activate.  Click the button to save your file.

You will see something like this:

=== Edit your file using AsciiDoc

Once you've got the file created, you can start editing it at your leisure.  To edit the file, all you have to do is click its name in the directory listing in GitHub and then press the "Edit" button:

Mark up your text using http://powerman.name/doc/asciidoc[AsciiDoc], which is similar to Markdown and other basic wiki-like markup formats.

=== Double check your submission and add your biography

Before you submit your request, make sure that you have:

* Run a spell check
* Make sure it's 400-500 words in length
* Add your biography
* Check the formatting to make sure it looks OK

Your biography should look like this:

----
// Need to have an example here
----

=== Submit a pull request

Once you've completed and double checked your submission, you're ready to submit it back to O'Reilly.  This is done by creating a "pull request" that will trigger the review process.

When you submit the pull request, you'll also be able to submit some additional information that will help us track your work:

* A title.  Please enter your name and the title of the piece.  For example, "Andrew Odewahn: Always Foo the Bar"
* A comment.  Tell us a little bit about your contribution, as well as anything else you think we should know.

=== Engage in back-and-forth with your editor

Once you submit your pull request, the project's editors will begin a back and forth with you in the discussion features.  You might be asked to make some revisions, shorten it, add additional elements, and so forth.
