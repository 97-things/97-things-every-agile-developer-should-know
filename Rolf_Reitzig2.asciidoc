==Software Engineering Costs of Quality

Leading software engineering organizations deliver 80% fewer defects and enjoy TWICE the productivity of average ones.  While the average team is fixing problems on a current release leading teams are developing even better features and functionality.

By understanding your organization's cost of quality and how much inefficiencies are costing you will be able to shift resources and attention towards prevention.  The result:  You’ll see an increase in not only software quality but also productivity, customer satisfaction and employee morale.  Defects delivered to the field, employee turnover and development cycle times will be significantly reduced.

This presentation will introduce attendees to the concept of software engineering costs of quality, quantify the differences in quality and productivity between average and leading software organizations and describe how software automation solutions improve quality and productivity and reduce costs of quality.
